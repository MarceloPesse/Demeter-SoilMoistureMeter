Ah, the good old times.

This here is the final project for my Bachelor's degree in electrical engineering.
The group was composed of:
  - Marcelo Pesse a.k.a. Me
  - Ricardo Bonfá Alberico 
  - Jhonston Dalcin

This project is basically an Arduino Leonardo with a 4-chanel 18-bit resolution ADC and an Xbee module.
For the sensor we used an EC-5 soil moisture sensor from Decagon.
(http://www.decagon.com/products/soils/volumetric-water-content-sensors/ec-5-soil-moisture-small-area-of-influence/)

The hardware sends all the info via an XBee module to a PC running a Daemon.
The Daemon then sends the data to a server and everybody is happy.


This project was made 3 years ago, so it’s probably not my best work.
